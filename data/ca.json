                "\"Electronic signature\" typically is defined as meaning an electronic sound, symbol, or process attached to or logically associated with an electronic record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the electronic record. An electronic signature may be as simple as typing in a name electronically, checking a box indicating an intent to sign or some similar process. However, electronic signatures only are permissible in electronic transactions between consenting parties. The use of an electronic signature requires the agreement of both parties to allow the use of the electronic signature and must be on a document that requires a signature and that is electronic.\nElectronic signatures on filings submitted through the Secretary of State's online process are the only electronic signatures that are acceptable for filings with the Secretary of State. Computer generated signatures or fonts made to look like a signature printed on paper filings are not acceptable.",
                "A digital signature is a type of electronic signature that requires specific security criteria to be met during the electronic transaction to ensure the signature is from the party it is supposed to be from. Digital signatures use a form of encryption as part of the signature process to ensure the signature cannot be duplicated or impersonated and require the receiving party to have the encryption key to decipher the signature.\nDigital signatures are not acceptable for business entity filings made with the California Secretary of State.",
